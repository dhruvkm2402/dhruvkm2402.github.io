Hi There, I'm passionate about enhancing autonomy and trust in AI-driven robots through my research in developing a Hybrid Learning framework. By blending physics and deep reinforcement learning, I aim to advance the intelligence and decision-making capabilities of autonomous robots.
I'm dedicated to developing solutions that positively impact our environment and lifestyle. I firmly believe in collaboration and am always open to working with others to tackle challenging problems in autonomy.
Let's advance autonomous technology together!
